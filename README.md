## Flash-Vote-on-AAVE-Protocol

![screenshot](aave.jpeg)

By using AAVE's flash loans to borrow 100k DAI and use it to buy governance tokens, vote with the tokens and then sell the tokens back.  All of this will happen in the span of one transaction.

When a governance token uses token-weighted voting (your voting power is based on the nubmer of tokens you have) they can potentially open themselves up to this vulnerability. 
In this case, the user does not have to hold any of their governance tokens in order to have a strong vote which defeats the purpose of the governance token.
